            <h2>GOOD THOUGHT </h2>
            <P>“A man is great by his deeds, not by his birth.
                “The mind will not remember what exactly happened. But the heart will always remember the feeling.”
                “New Motivational English Thoughts”
                “To succeed in your life, you have single-minded devotion to your goal.
                “Dreams, is not what you see in sleep, is the thing which never lets you sleep.
                “Every next level of your life demands a stronger you.”
                “Teachers can change lives with the right mix of chalk & challenges.”
                Words may lie, but actions always tell the truth.

            </P>
